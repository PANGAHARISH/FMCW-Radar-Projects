# FMCW Radar Data Processing Projects

## Overview

This repository contains two projects that explore **FMCW (Frequency Modulated Continuous Wave) radar systems** using MATLAB. The projects demonstrate radar signal processing techniques for precise range, velocity, and angle estimation of targets.

1. **FMCW Radar Data Processing using 2D DFT for Range-Doppler Analysis**  
2. **Enhanced Ranging and Angle Estimation Using Subsampled Measurements from Multiple FMCW Radars**

These projects showcase advanced signal processing methods, including the use of **2D DFT** and **compressed sensing** techniques, to enhance radar performance.
